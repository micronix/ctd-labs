## How to do a Demo

First, come up with a brief general description of the problem your app is trying to solve. For example, "My non-profit needs a way to track cats and dogs that come into a shelter." Tailor the description to the audience. In our case we vaugly remember what each of the projects do, but we might need some refresher.

Write down a list of all the features you have implemented. Don't include things like the login system, landing page, aout page, etc. Only do features that make the app unique. For example, "You can create categories, you can create dog and cat profiles and add notes to cats and dogs."

Organize all those features into a chronological way. In other words, think about what a person would do first when starting to use the app. For example, they might first need to create categories, then they could start adding cats and dogs.

Leave time for comments and questions at the end. Doing a demo for people who have not been deeply involved in your app should help you to take a step back from the minute details and help you to look at the big picture. They might also have a fresh prespective on the problem.

Good Luck
